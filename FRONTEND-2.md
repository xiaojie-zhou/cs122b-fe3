# Video Submission

## Create a video submission. 
YouTube private video, shared by link, works well for video submission for this class. Video submissions should be less than 2 minutes long and follow this scenario:
1. Off-screen, deploy your IDM Service, your Movies service, and your mini-frontend on your local device. Do not include this part in the video.
2. Open your browser and open a network panel (`CTRL + SHIFT + J` on Windows, or `COMMAND + OPTION + J` on Mac). Click the `Network` tab so we can see the network activity. Keep this panel open as you continue with the following steps.
3. Navigate to your website. (we should see the Login View with a link to Register Page)
4. Navigate to the Register View. Register a new user. (we should see a switch to the Login Page)
5. Login using the user you just created. (we should see a switch to Home Page)
6. The sort should be `title` with a `asc` order with a limit of `10`
7. Search for movies with directors named `Chris`. If necessary, scroll down to show the results.
6. Search for movies with `game` in their title. If necessary, scroll to show the results.
7. Still using `game` title: switch the sort to `rating`, the order by to `desc` and the limit to `25` and search
8. Still using the same sort, order, and limit: Search for movies released in the year `2005`. If necessary, scroll down to show the results.
9. Go to the next page (page 2) of the previous results.

## Submit the video
Submit a link to your video on the corresponding Canvas assignment.
